# Employee_Management_System_Using_SQL
The Employee Management System (EMS) is designed to streamline the management of employee data, job roles, and departmental information within an organization. This system allows for efficient tracking of employee details, job assignments, qualifications, and performance metrics. 

Key domain knowledge elements for this system include:
* Employee Information Management: The system stores personal details of employees such as name, contact information, gender, and unique login credentials. It is crucial for ensuring secure access and easy retrieval of employee records.

* Job Role Assignment: Each employee is associated with a specific job role, which is linked to the department they work in. This connection ensures that employees are correctly aligned with their job functions and responsibilities within the organization.

* Departmental Structure: The organization is divided into various departments (e.g., HR, Finance, IT), each with distinct job roles. The system should manage these departments and the employees assigned to each role efficiently.

* Payroll and Compensation: Employee compensation details, including salary and bonuses, are stored in the system. Payroll processing and salary allocations are automatically calculated based on the job roles and associated salary ranges.

* Qualifications and Skills Tracking: The system tracks employee qualifications, certifications, and skills to ensure that employees meet the requirements for their roles and identify opportunities for professional development.

* Leave and Absence Management: The system manages employee leave records, including vacation days, sick leaves, and other types of absences, with appropriate deductions applied to payroll based on the employeeâ€™s leave history.
